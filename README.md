My name is Camila Dominguez. I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I’m a recent education graduate from CoderHouse. I’ve been working at the design industry for 5 years, and I’m excited to find my first web developer position. I have several original design ideas that I look forward to implementing in futures projects. I attended CoderHouse and believe I would be a great fit for your position. I will continue my studies in UX/UI and it would be a joy for me to work in tech.
